title: My Favorite Ruby Rogues Episodes - Career and Organizational Management
---

Previous post was about episodes that discuss how to grow as an individual developer. This post is about episodes that discuss career management and organizational management.

This is the last post. I've mostly left out episodes about specific Ruby techniques and tools, and episodes about developer communities or social responsibilities as they are more specialized interest.

[063 RR Hiring Programmers](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/063-rr-hiring-programmers)

Resumes are useless. When panelists hire people, they ask these questions. Can the cadidate do the job? (And do I know what job he or she is going to do?) Is the candidate a good fit for the team? And recruiters are terrible.

[074 RR Developer Environments](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/074-rr-developer-environments)

What kind of environment makes developers productive? The panelists talk about various things, starting from monitors and standing desks through open office and strong light to choice of OS and background color of terminal window.

[216 RR Code Review Culture with Derek Prior](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/216-rr-code-review-culture-with-derek-prior)

[229 RR Adopting New Technology](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/229-rr-adopting-new-technology)

New technology should have minimal entry cost and maximal payoff. This should apply not just to the proponent of the new technology, but also all the other people who will be affected by the new technology. The panelists also talk about proper process to bring in the new technology.

[230 RR Hiring Diversely with Sarah Mei](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/230-rr-hiring-diversely-with-sarah-mei)

It's important to note that everyone has different culture. Each junior developer has different way of communication and thoughts, each senior developer has different way of commununication and thoughts. Same goes with managers, support staff, and so on. It's critical to recognize this fact because it affects the hiring process and organizational dynamics.

[233 RR Onboarding New Employees](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/233-rr-onboarding-new-employees)

The panelists discuss good and bad onboarding experiences they had, and onboarding in various contexts such as remote versus local, team versus project, and role of senior developers in onboarding process.

[240 RR What Makes a Good Manager with Marcus Blankenship](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/240-rr-what-makes-a-good-manager-with-marcus-blankenship)

You need to let go of the need to prove your coding skills - it has nothing to do with being acknowledged as a manager. In fact, when you become a manager, don't get involved in production code because it's not your responsibility now. Instead, focus on helping your team. Have a weekly meeting with each individual of the team you manage. Shorten the feedback loop.

[249 RR The Normalization of Deviance with Dan Luu](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/249-rr-the-normalization-of-deviance-with-dan-luu)

[264 RR Code Hospitality with Nadia Odunayo](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/264-rr-code-hospitality-with-nadia-odunayo)

The discussion centers around the concept of hospitality. Onboarding a new developer is like welcoming a new person moving into the town. Pairing with another person is like acting as a host to the session. Maintain such level of empathy and care when you write code or communicate with colleagues.

New developers need psychological support more than new tutorials or books. Share them stories of how you learned, keep encouraging and recognizing their small successes, get better at explaining things in a way that listeners can understand - they are responsibilities of senior developers. Likewise, it's the responsibility of newer developers to keep asking questions.

[276 RR Hiring and Retention with Kenzi Connor](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/276-rr-hiring-and-retention-with-kenzi-connor)

The panelists analyze how come software development has become a senior-obsessed field. Companies are not enthusiastic about hiring junior developers and training them, because many of them leave after a few years. That's where the root of problem lies. It's not hiring - it's retention. The panelists discuss why developers leave and how to mitigate that.

[277 RR GROWS Method with Andy Hunt](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/277-rr-grows-method-with-andy-hunt)
