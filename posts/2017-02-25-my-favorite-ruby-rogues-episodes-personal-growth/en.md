[047 RR Coding Disciplines with Dan Kubb](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/047-rr-coding-disciplines-with-dan-kubb)

Try different coding styles by setting constraints to yourself, and see how those constraints affect you. It's an application of scientific method of trial and error in finding better coding practices. All code is experimental.

[077 RR Complexity with Glenn Vanderburg](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/077-rr-complexity-with-glenn-vanderburg)

Complexity is so hard to deal with for us that by default human brain responds to it by simplifying the problem - often overly so. But what are the costs of such oversimplification? This concerns not just programming but also interpersonal complexities.

[086 RR Learning From The Past with Arlen Walker](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/086-rr-learning-from-the-past-with-arlen-walker)

It's important to learn from past mistakes. You will still make bad code despite following good principles, but it's still better than making bad code by following bad principles. 

[129 RR Sharpening Tools with Ben Orenstein](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/129-rr-sharpening-tools-with-ben-orenstein)
