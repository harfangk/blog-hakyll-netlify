After a year and a half as a product manager, with two product launches under my belt, I decided to go back to engineering. While it was a fun ride, ultimately I feel happier with engineering. I learned a lot though, and would like to share what I've learned with others. These would be especially helpful to people in similar situation - engineers considering moving on to product management or new product managers with engineer background.

It cannot be stressed how important communication is
Stakeholders
Other departments, boss, leadership
Team members

Build up political capital within the company
Reduce risks
