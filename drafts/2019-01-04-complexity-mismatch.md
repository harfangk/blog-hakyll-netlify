Complexity mismatch between actual project and language/framework

Rails is good for web apps within certain range of complexity

But becomes unfit for more complex things

specification keeps changing, and software is expected to adapt

JS/vue/react/elm

Curse of winner

in traditional engineering or architecture, change is prohibitively expensive. fundamental change is impossible.

software is deceptively malleable. it's malleable, but not that much. rewriting is painful and often more work than expected.

gradual accommodation of complexity.

racket?

an error message assumes full knowledge of the language and system.
