title: About
---
**I'm a novice developer**. I started with Ruby on Rails, then learned programming with Ruby. Somehow I ended up going ever deeper into functional programming land and learned Elixir, Haskell, Idris, and Elm. Currently mostly working with Elm.

**I'm a generalist**. I've been a co-founder, interpreter, and military officer. My foundation lies in psychology, with human and software languages as my favorite media of expression for creating values. 

**I like**: learning, reading stuff, listening to others, discussing, writing, exploring new things.
**I dislike**: intolerance, irresponsibility, authoritarianism, inefficiency.
**I suck at**: making jokes.
